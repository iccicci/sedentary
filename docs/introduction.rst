Introduction
============

This package is designed **to make easy the process of applying changes to the database after model definition
changes**, more than offer a quick and easy database access interface. Applying changes to the database after releasing
a new version of the application is often a frustrating problem, usually solved with migration systems. Applying
changes to the database during the development stage, often results in a complex sequence of backward and forward steps
through the migrations; this process is complicated more and more especially when working in team with concurrent
changes to the models (or the database schema). This package tries to solve these problems all in once.
